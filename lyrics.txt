[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

[Verse 2]
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

[Outro: James Blake] ×9
Could it be the way that I'll catch up[Produced by Key Wane]

[Intro: Aziz Ansari (from the movie "Funny People")]
"I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy"

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same, J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook]

[Outro: Baka]
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G, been have up di ting dem from time, G. So I don't know what's wrong with these little wasteman out here eh? Y'all need to know yourself."[Produced by Nineteen85, Majid Jordan, and Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Verse + Hook]

[Bridge: Majid Jordan]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

[Hook][Verse 1]
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Hook]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

[Verse 2]
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a Walkie-Talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just because" song
Damn

[Hook][Part 1: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog
Nothing was the same, dog[Produced by The Fam; co-produced by Boi-1da]

[Hook]
Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to...

[Verse]
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it
I mean for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to...oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN

[Hook]

[Outro]
That's why I don't read the news, it’s garbage
And the editor that wrote the thing, he's garbage
Got guys on my back about schedulin', saying it's too tough
Well guess what?
It's Division-1 football! It's the SEC!
Heck, you pledged, didn't ya?
Go play intramurals, brother, go play intramurals[Verse 1]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga
That's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Hook]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh, well
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Hook]

[Outro: Birdman]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote nines, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly it's jet time, stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga, stunt nigga[Produced by Mike Zombie]

[Intro]
Started...
(Zombie on the track)

[Hook]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my momma's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show and we...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here, that's popping off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame, cause we...

[Hook][Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Verse 1]
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see if I'm finished

[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Intro: Woman on phone]
Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good.. you still working?
Tonight... right now? Did I go out? Yeah, I went out
I went.. I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit.. wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious..

[Verse 1]
Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that I'mma call her anyway and say

[Hook]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

[Verse 2]
Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that I'mma call you anyway and say

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, "Well, I'm sorry"

[Bridge]

[Interlude]
You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble[Produced by Nineteen85 and Sampha]

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Hook]

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'[Produced by THC and DJ Dahi]

[Verse 1: Drake]
You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, with Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook 2x]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Hook]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment
That’s why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
‘Cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’
And this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty
And this ain’t no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
‘Cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Hook][Produced by PARTYNEXTDOOR, co-produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
Why you keep askin' me about (why)?
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Hook]
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

[Verse 2]
Why you keep askin' me about (why)?
Couple other things I’d rather do than talk 'bout that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances
He’s not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh
Tryna wake up and have you with me, oh
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
(I threw my hands in the air said show me somethin')
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house, she made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "when that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that my nigga till we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' bout "you gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I'm matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime said you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a xan for the boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another xan for your boy
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy
(Fring)[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Hook]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Hook]

[Outro]
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accepts you..[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Hook]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse 1]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Hook][Intro]
Gotta do what I gotta do

[Verse 1]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now? Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic, they say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

First niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me
Can you please remind me? (Ball so hard)
This shit crazy y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82 and I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird, we ain't even s'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here it's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock, Rolleys that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(Ball so hard) Let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave, just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi town's D. Rose, I’m moving the Nets to BK

[Hook]
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)

[Verse 2: Kanye]
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all."
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain’t it Jay?
What she order, fish filet?
"Your whip so cold" – this old thing?
Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand, fuck that bitch she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French but I’m in France, I’m just sayin'
Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga? What’s Louis, my killa?
What’s drugs, my dealer? What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest, cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude]
“I don't even know what that means
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No it's not, it's gross (Gets the people going)”

[Hook]

[Outro: Kanye]
You are now watching the throne, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin, actin’ like the summer ain’t mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building, they hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m 'bout to kill it, how you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone (I’m definitely in my zone)[Produced by Kanye West and Che Pope with additional production from Eric Danchild, Noah Goldstein, No ID and Mike Dean]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody

[Verse 1]
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

[Bridge]
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West & Frank Ocean]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again, too high)

Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

[Verse 2]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Verse 3]
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas

To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie
'til death but do your part, unholy matrimony

[Outro]
That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (breathe)

Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have

Oh God!

[Hook: Big Sean]

Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I'm coming out the driveway
It's grind day, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
Yup, she trying get me that poo-tang
I might let my crew bang, my crew deeper than Wu Tang
I'm rolling with... fuck I'm saying? Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr! I'm pulling up in that Bruce Wayne
But I'm the fucking villain, man, they kneeling when I'm walking in the building
Freaky women I be feeling from the bank accounts I'm filling
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that's killing everything that he see for the dough

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm talking Ye, yeah, I'm talking Rih
Yeah, I'm talking B, nigga, I'm talking me
Yeah, I'm talking bossy, I ain't talking Kelis
Your money too short, you can't be talking to me
Yeah, I'm talking LeBron, we ball in our family tree
G.O.O.D. Music drug-dealing cousin, ain't nothing fuckin' with we, me
Turn that 62 to 125, 125 to a 250
250 to a half a million, ain't nothin' nobody can do with me
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years, ain't hug his son since the second grade
He never told. Who he gonna tell? We top of the totem pole
It's the Dream Team meets the Supreme Team
And all our eyes green it only means one thing
You ain't fucking with the clique

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival - the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I'm talking business, we talking CIA
I'm talking George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gone kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Everytime I'm in Vegas they screaming like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feeling Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, Gisele, nah that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talking to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talking back
Fucking with my clique

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker – now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example:

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'm-a need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get
Ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
"This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit them with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: "What you gonna do now?
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now"
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles
I kill the block, I murder the avenues
I rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She's on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give them whiplash
I think big, get cash, make them blink fast
Now look at what you just saw
This is what you live for
I'm a motherfucking monster

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I crossed the line
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am heading home[Intro: Fuzzy Jones]

Build a house up on that ass, that's an ass-tate
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye don't we do this every day-day (huh?)
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
(And niggas still hating) so much hate I need an AK

All she want is some heel money, all she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out, I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist, them heads turning, that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras, that's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two-door preference, roof gone, George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake so your Duncan Hines is irrelevant
Lambo, Murcie-lago, she go wherever I go, wherever we go, we do it pronto

You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em give me fifty million or I'm-a quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-your-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus, yo my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Something about Mary, she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I'll move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Ok, now ketchup to my campaign, coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time, drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Travel)
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a Band-Aid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhyming, co-signed by Louis Vuitton (Yup!)
Horsepower, horsepower, all this Polo on I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand, I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin'
All my cars is foreign, all my broads is foreign
Money tall like Jordan

They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin'

Here come some conservative Baptists

But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'

Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit

Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'

Ready-ready for action

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen

[Hook]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Run away from me, baby, run away
Run away from me, baby, run away
When it starts to get crazy, why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away fast as you can

[Verse 2 - Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats, all white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic, I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats, preach

[Hook]

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin
Made a stripe like a zebra, I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil, last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m., I wonder if they got cabs still?
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepherd
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap: preach

[Hook][Produced by DJ Toomp and Kanye West]

[Intro - Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day, class started 2 hours ago
Oh am I late? No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Hook][Produced by Kanye West, Noah Goldstein, The Twilite Tone and Young Chop]

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
Cause my niggas still selling dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23, just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, coke money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit – ungrateful niggas, I don't like

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same, nigga I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, riding for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights, going hard the whole night
Cause I ain't going back to my old life, I promise

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

[Hook][Produced by Kanye West, Evian Christ, Dom Solo, Noah Goldstein, Arca and Mike Dean]

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Bridge: Assassin]
That's all dem can do (Say wah, say wah)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting, a' dat man do
Action thing yo a badman thing

[Verse 2: Assassin]
I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel say we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We agon' smile 'pon court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J

[Hook: Kanye West and Justin Vernon]
That’s right, I’m in it
(Should’ve known I would fall)
I’m in it
(Steppin' on cracks on the floor)
That’s right
(And your boys at your door)
That’s right, I’m in it
(Well, you need to fight for your own)
That’s right, I’m in it
(Then don’t let me at your table)
I’m in it
(If you just gonna lay there)
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

[Hook 2: Assassin, Justin Vernon, and Kanye West]
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all dem can do (say wah, say wah?)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out
(That's all dem can do)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman thing, a' dat man do
I'll be gone long, grab that...

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker
Star fucker
Star fucker
Who, where?

[Outro: Kanye West]
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League
Uh, I be speakin' Swaghili[Produced by RZA, No I.D., Kanye West, Mike Dean, and Jeff Bhasker]

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you’ve peeped the scene
You haven’t, the real one’s far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it’s awful, blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addictions
Well, gather ‘round children, zip it, listen:

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJ's need to listen to the models
"You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?"
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up in Sleepy Hollow

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

[Hook]

[Bridge: Bon Iver & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hands of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Hook]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up, Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions"
I know he the most high
But I am a close high

That's our cosa nostra

[Verse 1]
I’m living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power (21st-Century schizoid man)
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain’t got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I’ll see you in the morning
Huh? I’ll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Hook]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
Till then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 2]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he’s so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation
Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it I’m killing this shit
I know damn well y’all feeling this shit
I don’t need your pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How Ye doing? I’m surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I’m driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

[Outro]
Now this will be a beautiful death
(I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go)
You got the power to let power go?

I can hold my liquor
But this man can’t handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Bitch I'm back out my coma
Wakin' up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla
I'm hangin' on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floatin'
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late-night organ donor
After that, he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless
When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Bridge: Justin Vernon]
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh I wanna phone home

Whose fault?

[Intro: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort, and my first result
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it you know we both were wrong

[Hook: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call her names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call her names, names, for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else"
I took a piss and dismiss it like "fuck it"
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you are having a good time
Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
One a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, "Yeezy, I ain't your right girl"
You'll probably find one of them "I like art"-type girls
All of the lights, she-was-caught-in-the-hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Now who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely" - Chloe Mitchell

[Hook x2: Kanye West]
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

["The Best Birthday": Chris Rock]
Ohh my God
Baby you done took this shit to another mother fucking level!
Now a neighborhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be gettin no pussy like this
God damn, God damn!
Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now you God damn disgusting!
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you mother fucking butt ass naked...
With them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on...
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level!
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now! Shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, okay? And I, and I love it...
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how... how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I'd never fucked before!
I was in there like "Oh, shit! I never been here before!"
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before!
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy. And when I see that nigga, I'mma thank him. I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker, I'm-a shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch!
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
Even with the bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted!
I saw this shit, I saw it, Twista had this shit on in The Source!
I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source!
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?

Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I’ve forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin’ for the love of ballin’
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it’s random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won’t be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
This is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I’m in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn’t sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jump shot, running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the World’s game, this is my Olympics
We make ‘em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest nigga, I must have missed it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said “take them glasses off and get in the pool”
It’s been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a Crip said, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don’t believe in yesterday
And what’s a black Beatle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I’m sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell ‘em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I’m coming after whoever who has it
I’m coming after whoever. Who has it?
You blowin' up, that’s good, fantastic
That y’all, it's like that y'all
I don’t really give a fuck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about two things, my black balls

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one L's
Kites off to jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red, bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can’t live, you dying, you give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Hook: Rihanna]
All of the lights, all of the lights
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

[Elly Jackson]
Fast cars, shooting stars
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it you can get it for the rest of your life

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]
Cop lights, flash lights
Spot lights, strobe lights
Street lights
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe
You should go and get your own
Getting mine, baby
Got to let these niggas know
Getting right, babe

[Verse 3: Fergie]
Unemployment line, credit card declined
Did I not mention I was about to lose my mind?
And also was about to do that line
K, Okay, you know we going all the way this time
We going all the way this time

[Hook: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I've been rockin' with the team, Tha Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Lord knows I'll murk one of these niggas, yeah
His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is "sayonara, nigga"
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

[Hook: Drake]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Rich young nigga that ain't never had to trick
Slim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick
If she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip
I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt"
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Motherfuck award shows and motherfuck the press like that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Motherfuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw motherfuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets
Gone

[Outro: Drake]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I’m grindin’, I’m grindin’, I’m grindin’ I promise

My girl like it rough she said “find me a diamond”
Her body be grindin’, 
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic
That make us believe, when we lyin’, we honest, I love you
Pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors

It ain’t rocket science just rockets
I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Whew, I ain’t crazy, I’m krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic
Music too loud to hear sirens, we pop, pop, pop up where you stay
Knock, knock, knock, anyone home?
Pop, pop, pop, pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas that’s grindin’

Yo' bitch fucking anonymous niggas

Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners?
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit, I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird

We'll bring Gucci bag in this bitch
And you know what's stashed in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out
Like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven, I work twenty-four seven
Ain’t got time to bond with no bitch
Heard Jay Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit
Where I got it from? Nevermind that shit


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
I got a new vision for all my shit
I don’t know what to call that shit
I know, I’m selling all of my cars
I’m selling all of my watches
I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit
I’m a different breed with this shit
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch
And I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte Bardot hanging over my bed
Fifty mill in one room, you, you could ask anyone out here
Who running the game? And they’ll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you
Oh look, they fuck with me now
I think they’re hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now"
I’m like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka that’s grindin'

[Hook]

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing
(Grindin’, grindin’)
(grindin’, grindin’)
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Than peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space
Believe that

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin’
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin’

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)

Long as my bitches love me

Long as these bitches love me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy ass nigga stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire and these hoes love me like Satan, man
Fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick, she's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better then Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said "Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody"
Girl, I fuck who I want and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said "I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud"
I said "Baby just make me cum
Then don't make a sound"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Real nigga fuck these haters
These hoes got pussies like craters
Can't treat these hoes like ladies, maaaan!
Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, $69.96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest to chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down, I'm arrestin' this bitch
All my bitches love me and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes names
But then I would be snitching
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges
Lil Tunechi!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne] (x2)
I lost a few good bitches
Met some more bad bitches
And I be schooling them niggas
Pose for your class picture
Now kiss my ass if you hating

Bitch

[Intro]
Young Money! You dig? Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire
I'm a Young Money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cause I don't write shit cause I ain't got time
Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father, mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, pussy popping
Tell the coppers ha-ha-ha-ha, you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules, if you can't beat 'em then you pop 'em, you can't man 'em then you mop 'em, you can't stand 'em then you drop 'em
You pop 'em cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Hook]
Mothafucka, I'm ill

[Verse 2]
A million here a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoke in the thinnest air, I open the Lamborghini
Hoping them crackers see me like look at that bastard Weezy
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothing, nothing, you ain't scaring nothing
On some faggot bullshit, call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch, call me on my Sidekick
Never answer when it's private, damn I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
And she ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: you ain't got shit
Motherfucka I'm ill, not sick and I'm okay, but my watch sick
Yeah, my drop sick, yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick, I'm it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
They say I'm rapping like B.I.G, Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil' Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that boy, you knew that, true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't O U like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushing flowers
Than to be in the pen sharing showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Mothafucka, I say life ain't shit without me
Chrome lips poking out the coupe, look like it's pouting
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain, dare me
Don't you compare me cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me, they don't feel me, but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat[Produced by Bangladesh]

[Hook]
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin, what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'mma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' back in
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall: outfielder
You know I'mma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'mma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind ya"
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side, cause ain't no peace on my side, bitch
I'm a man, I visit urinals with pride
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tell me something I don't know, I'm flexing on 'em like torsos
These niggas slipping like bar soap, these niggas listening use Morse code
Boy a nigga sipping like parched throat, (clears throat) excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit, we'll check into it like the room cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast die young and leave a beautiful corpse, yes Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks, I sent five bricks with four chicks
Ridin' with these guns that's carpoolin', bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in, nigga miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that, and watch everybody I toast with
Kill everybody you close with, just don’t stick your nose in
My bullshit cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live, you tell that nigga I owe him
Yeah, I got my mind right, my money right, my head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a lil blurry but it's stayin' on my quota
And we find out moms address and your head get mailed over
Nigga you make that bed, you lay in that bed or get that bitch made over
Tunechi

[Hook]
You so crazy
Tunechi, you so crazy - bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch

[Verse 2]
Tell me something I don’t know, I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money drugs bitches guns, niggas call me mucho
Got witches all in my broom closet, got little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes, kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys
Tell the cops we don’t name drop that's like dropping newborns
Nigga you crazy

[Interlude]
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me

[Verse 3]
Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me something I haven’t seen
And give me what help Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I’ll never be
And I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me versus me I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputies  big letter B, need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like
Everything from amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarines and Grenadine

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Tell me something I don’t know
Like what happened to hard coke
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills and weed
Liquor and dick, she gotta micro manage
I'm just eating rappers, they go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots, I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit, on my balance
Lil Tunechi

[Outro]
Stand up niggas
(And I bump my head when I stand up)[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
AK on my nightstand, right next to that Bible
But I swear with these 50 shots, I'll shoot it out with 5-0
Pockets gettin too fat, no weight watchers no lipo
Money talks. Bullshit walks on a motherfucking tight rope
And I make that pussy tap out, I knock that pussy out cold
Nigga you get beat the crap out but that's just how the dice roll
These hoes want that hose pipe, so I give all these hoes pipe
She get on that dick and stay on, all night like porch lights
Lets do it, fuck talking; we out here, we balling
And I'm spraying at these rusty niggas like WD-40
We fucked up, we Truk'd up, no if ands or but fucks
Bitch niggas go behind yo back like nun-chucks and that's fucked up
But my hoes down, my cups up, my niggas down for whatever
These bitches think they're too fly well tell em hoes I pluck feathers
I'm Tunechi, Young Tunechi, I wear Trukfit, fuck Gucci
She's blowing kisses at me with her pussy lips, smooches
And that's 2 Chainz...

[Hook: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne]
Look at you, now look at us
All my niggas look rich as fuck
All my niggas live rich as fuck
All my niggas look rich as fuck

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Never talk to the cops, I don't speak Pig Latin
I turn the penny to a motherfucking Janet Jackson
Tell the bitches that be hatin I ain't got no worries
I just wanna hit and run like I ain't got insurance
Ho whats yo name whats yo sign, Zodiac Killer
All rats gotta die, even Master Splinter, yeah, Murder 187
I be killing them bitches I hope all dogs go to Heaven
And I got Xanax, percocet, promethazine with codeine
Call me Mr. Sandman, I'm sellin' all these hoes dreams
Got a white girl with big titties, flat ass TV screen
I keep a bad bitch call me the BB King
And you know I got that mouth out her
And put that bitch out like a house fire
I'm killing these hoes like Michael Myers
I eat that cat just like a lion
And I can't trust none of these niggas
Can't trust none of these hoes
And I see your girl when I want, I got that ho TiVo'd
Got a red ass bitch with a red ass pussy
Nigga try me, that a dead ass pussy
Cause y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth I don't care who's looking
All I know is I love my bitch
That pussy feel just like heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovel in the dirt, R.I.P. - Rest In Pussy
Light that shit then pass that shit, we gon get so smoked out
And then I went got locked up, every night I dreamt I broke out
One Time for them pussy niggas, that's that shit I don't like
We eating over here nigga, fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz...

[Hook][Verse 1]
I tell her "now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me baby it's real
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere
But here, baby you know the deal
Cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 2]
I tell her "now gon' pop that pussy for me"
Haters can't see me but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about "I", give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'm-a have em checkin pulses
They say "choose wisely" that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on my dick and do a full split!

[Hook][Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find the pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook][Produced by Chase N. Cashe & Hit-Boy]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Trying to get in where I fit in; no room for a nigga
But, soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
Cause, all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head
Bitch, I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside

[Hook]

[Bridge: Eminem]
I'm gone, I'm gone
It hurts but I never show this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream "fuck em all"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes. Got em cooking, boy
This crooked mind of mines got em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fucking clock, I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'mma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words so your fucking heads better nod
Or I'mma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk; you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast
Your fuckin' head'll spin, dogg
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, ill fuckin'

[Hook][Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fo’ fo’ bulldog: my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker "fetch"
I’m fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don’t sleep, so Weezy can’t rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Big black nigga in a icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Count the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be hot, swish!
I’m swimming in a yellow bitch in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down
Thought it were bullet proof till he got hit the fifth time
Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I’m the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected got killers off in Chicago

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Talk stupid, get ya head popped
I got that Esther, bitch I’m Redd Foxx
Big B’s, Red Sox, I get money to kill time, dead clocks
Your fucking with a nigga who won’t give a fuck
Empty the clip then roll the window up
Pussy nigga sweet, them niggas Cinnabon
I’m in a red bitch, she said she finna come
200 thou' on a chain, I don’t need a piece
That banana clip, let Chiquita speak
Dark shades, Eazy E, five letters, YMCMB
Bitch ass nigga, pussy ass nigga
I see ya looking, with ya looking ass nigga
You know the rules, kill them all and keep moving
If I died today it’d be a holiday

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I’m not a star, somebody lied
I got a chopper in the car, so don’t make it come alive
Rip yo ass apart then I pull myself together
YMCMB, double M, we rich forever
The bigger the bullet the more that bitch gon' bang
Red on the wall, Basquiat when I paint
Red Lamborghini till I gave it to my bitch
My first home invasion, papi gave me 40 bricks
Son of a bitch, then I made a great escape
Ain't it funny momma, only son be baking cakes
Pull up in the sleigh, hop out like I’m Santa Claus
Niggas gather round, got gifts for each and all of y’all
Take it home and let it bubble that's the double up
If you get in trouble that just mean you fucking up
It’s a cold World I need a bird to cuddle up
I call the plays, motherfucker huddle up

[Hook][Verse 1: Euro]
I couldn't have done it better, I couldn't have done this shit any other way
I made it now, only tryin' convince me to make it another day
Glad I could see another day
I do this shit for my squad, my home team, my family, fuck what another say
I'm here now, it's all clear now, somebody pour up
I'm eating good, y'all can't see my competition til I throw up
I'm tore up but I keep shit 100 that's from the toes up
Last night, it felt like I ran through 4 clubs, stood on the couch, and every single one of them screaming out "Hoes down and bros up"
It's different when we show up, kicking doors up
I'm a young stunna, young Wayne, I'm Young Money I'm growed up
Like I'm new here but I'm nuclear, that's a bomb threat, mothafucka, watch how I blow up
I'm good, I'm reminded I'm good from time to time
I'm fine, I be spending time with the greatest of all-time all the time
And ever since I'm living life every night like it's '99
I'm way ahead of my time I think I was only 8 at that time
I rep them five letters forever
Would someone just tell the bartender to mix my drink while I mix my thoughts my business and pleasure?
I'm clever, long money all around me
I just hope that I live long enough, long enough to measure
We should take pictures sippin' Cristal in COOGI sweaters
And I'm still getting better, nigga, what's better?
They said I'd never do it, now I'm looking like, "Nigga, what's never?"
And now they run from us when they see us, boy, that money's pressure
Plaques on the wall of every building that I walk into
Phone taps cause they curious, careful what you talk into
Living the star life you never know who you'll run into
Like, baby I can change your life, just leave everything that you been through
And ride

[Hook: Euro]
Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright
Long as the drinks on ice then we alright
Long as these private flights then we alright
Long as we living right then we alright
Long as it's high life then we alright
Cause I love it more than anything
Boy, it's money over everything, we been alright

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yea, It's money over everything
We motivated, flying over everything
We make something out of nothing; what up 5?
Bag full of every president that ever died
Yeah, spraying everything that's in the way
We eating over here extended clips, 50 plates
It's a lifestyle, stunna life everyday
A million ones, we can throw this shit a million ways
Young'un, if you're alright then we alright
Night life GTV popping every night
Fly rich in a different city, bright lights
With my niggas, rich gang and living high life
Yea, guns in the basement
Millions in the wall, GTV cases
If it's fuck em' then it's fuck em' all
Audemars and cigars in them new toys

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Do this shit for rizzeal
Young Money, Rich Gang, ya heard me with big ears
You just a crocodile, I drink a full cup of his tears
Can’t recognize you, nigga, like Santa cut off his beard
And Tunechi, he gon’ be alright, as long as he got his pills
I’m higher than my bitch bills, stop crying about 'em, bitch, chill
I'm working on that Carter V, I got this bitch in fifth gear
I can't stand these niggas, I'ma lie down or sit still
Get tied down with that fucking steel at your eyebrow or your fucking grill
Catch you while you laid up, straight up, bunny ears
I shoot your fucking fade up, ratchets don't touch me
If that pussy smell like catfish salmon trout or guppies
I ain't trippin' over no ho, treat that ho like a servant
I know that ho better know, how to deep throat like a serpent
But loose lips sink ships, but I just let these hoes Worship
She think I'm a window of opportunity, close curtains
Tunechi


[Hook][Verse 1]
Uh, my mind’s filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It’s Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin yea
My country tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

[Verse 2]
Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me, I’mma hide by abroad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I’m wired off a socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

[Verse 3]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshner
I don’t play boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of commands, I’m the missing link

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

[Outro]
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
The police are looking for me, I’mma hide by abroad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I’m wired off a socket, but still shockin em
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today ?[Hook: Detail]
You can look me in my face (I ain't got no worries)x3
See the sh-rooms keep me up (I ain't got no worries)x3
You see money right there, yeah that's Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah that's Mack Maine right there, and we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there redbone mangos right there
See them sh-roomies right there we ain't got no worries

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi in this bitch, errybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be diggin' me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear’ll have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleep
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I’ll send them up shit’s creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It's ok if you turn up just don't turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I'm smoking I grew it
B’s up, Blood Gang; Piru it, and all rats gotta die even Stuart
On my private jet and my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch Nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don't get dissed, you get disfigured
She say sorry I didn't shave so that pussy a little furry
I put that pussy in my face: I ain't got no worries
Tunechi

[Hook: Detail]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain't got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar, I say "Why you in a hurry?"
She say "Why you asking questions?" I say "Bitch you trynna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that Donkey Kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my ho, I swear she was with my ho
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch it's Tunechi and I'm out chea, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit be a long story
YEAHHH, OHH SHIT, UH HUH, YEAHH, YOUNG MULA BABY!

[Hook: Detail][Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

[Hook] x2
I'mma blunt blowin', Polo drawers showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga

[Verse 2]
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu

[Hook]
I'mma blunt blowin', polo drawers showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust yo ass nigga

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grin
Young Mula, skinnies and some Supras
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Outro]
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home
It's Young Mula, baby[Produced by Infamous and Drew Correa]

[Intro]
I feel big, you know what I mean
Like not...not big in the sense of weight
You know what I mean...like gaining weight
Or nothing like that, like colossal
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Hook]
Hey Mr. Carter
Tell me where have you been
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why

[Verse 1]
To you forever: from me to you
I heard somebody say Church, I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer then "Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice"
I got the flow, I'm trying to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof, so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'mma leave it to
God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'mma murder Y, kill O and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter then the Sun
Got Spring hating on me cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me cause I'm colder than y'all
And I would never, I would never, I would never Fall
I'm bein' hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: "Wayne quit!"
Cause Wayne win and they lose
I call them April babies, cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up
Feet up like a, paraplegic
I'm, paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing, old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream "Soo woo and "Da da do"
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came, and if not then why bother
Show no mercy to Murcielago
Far from being the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey, got me a molotov cocktail
Flow, even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The Dope Boy just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game it's your go
(Young!)

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah
And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector
Camacho Man Randy Savage
Far from average, above status-quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow and when I pass
They say, "what up, Killa?"
Man, stop bringing up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy baby

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in this dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Ahh, we'll lose 2 lives: yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Miss Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, dripping tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Miss Carter grieve[Intro]
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it

[Verse 1]
Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the..

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can't understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

[Verse 2]
I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin at the..

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..

[Interlude]
MJ taught me that
Take 'em to Mars, man

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hey B.P., looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time?

So why are we, talking to each other again...[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib & Omen]

[Verse 1]
Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and hollering
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends, now her friends ain't even fucking with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spelling shit right
I text her back, tell her it's life
Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And I when get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, polo drawers
Now make me take this polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour than I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
They go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now she got on a fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold on, she say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off: both lines
It's about to get nasty: pork rinds
She came hard both times
We both say we single and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5, since '05!
Know that!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass
Witchyo' fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'
Like a salad no dressing
Take ya to ya favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
I'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin'
Oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwaver oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like yo sister maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh isn't that sweet
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass

[Hook: Chance the Rapper] x4
This is not a love song
This is a you song
I just happen to love you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your asscrack
Lemme get back on track...
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's world, she say, "What is this world coming to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, "Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like, "What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay that's a dead subject, you bring it up that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

[Hook: Chance the Rapper]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I mean how many times
How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?
I loved the pictures
I needed that I swear I did
I was just thinking about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, what up 5?
I-I love you too...I do[Produced by DJ Nasty & Lee Majors]

Hov, fuck with ya boy

[Verse 1]
Okay nigga, I got 'em, point 'em out and I got 'em
Let 'em get a lil buzz, then we robbin' for pollen
We ain't killin' no minors, you niggas still in the minors
And your bitch, we gonna blind her, can't pick us out of the lineup
I swear lord knows I'ma murk one of these niggas
Shoot you in your earth, and get earthworms on me, nigga
I been did my time, I'm getting better with time
But real niggas don't whine, we'll burn down your vineyard
I been ballin' since cornrows, still duckin' the narcos
My little niggas in war mode, you spark it up, we charcoal
Got a bad bitch with long hair that have bad days when the mall closed
I'm a big dog, big doghouse, make ashtrays out of dog bowls, yeah
Blessins on top of sins, restin' with topless twins
Picture me broke but forgot to take the top off the lens
In the restaurant, I’m with Slim, wrestlin' with lobster limbs
Talkin' about some M's, it's soundin' like gospel hymns
Yes, lord

[Interlude]
We on that D'usse, me and my nigga Euro
Tina turn up in this bitch
We got Lauren in this bitch
Serena Pink in this bitch, better known as Pinky

[Verse 2]
Hollygrove nigga, rest in peace, Lil Kevin
Rest in peace, Lil Beezy, rest in peace, Big Sausage
The world is mine, I am selfish
I am a shark, fuck them shellfish
Everybody in the building, well I left that bitch like Elvis
Nigga, please
Pops treated mom like Billie Jean
Like hot sauce, I put it on everything
I'ma give that fuckin' woman everything, everything
Here we go, bitch I'm cool, Coolio
She say "Tune, do me slow"
How many fish did Hootie blow?
I don't know, fuck who knows?
I got a redbone with two golds
And she snort too much of that Michael Jackson
That bitch gon' need a new nose
I ain't got time for you hoes
Shit I only have two goals
And that is "Get Money, Get Money"
Now I'm ridin' 'round the city with the top off the Maybach
Lookin for a motherfuckin' spot we can skate at
Elvis left the building and I take these hoes to Graceland
And I got more bounce, to the 28 grams
I ain't stuntin' these niggas
Eyes look Chinese, Wayne-chung to these niggas
Wayne-chung bitch!
More than one bitch
This for my niggas, we shall overcome, bitch
From New Orleans, niggas dyin' over dumb shit
You know we give the pastor hell, make the nun strip
Yeah I might have them bricks, call me Brick Cannon
Nina on my lap, what you want from Santa?
I might get money, fuck bitches
Kill niggas and smoke weed
I'm married to this real shit
And I'm a wife beater, no sleeves
Do it for my hood
That 44 ain't no good
You better bring that chopper
Cause we gon' have them choppers
Yeah I do it for my hood
That 45 ain't no good
You better bring the chopper
Cause we gon' have them choppers, nigga
We gon' have them choppers
We gon' have them choppers
You better bring the chopper
Cause we gon' have them choppers, yeah

You better bring the chopper
Cause we gon' have them choppers, nigga
Mula!

[Outro]
My nigga Hood in this bitch
Still on that D'usse
Shout out my nigga Lil Twist, my lil brother
He just passed out in the club the other night off that D'usse
Threw up on the owner
Owner talkin' about he wanted his money back
He wanted half of the money back
Twist took all the money and left
That's some Young Money shit

"We got a young brother that stands for something! We got a young brother that believes in the all of us! Brother Kendrick Lamar! He's not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author! And if you read between the lines, we'll learn how to love one another! But you can't do that — right on! — I said, you can't do that without loving yourself first."

[Sample]
This is a world premiere!

[Intro]
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
Praying that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But ain't no nigga never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Hook]
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)

[Verse 1]
Everybody looking at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times our potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner and a line full of fiends
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
These days of frustration keep y'all on tucking rotation
I duck these gold faces, post up fee-fi-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
The strong in me, I still smile

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)
Fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
My heart undone (My heart undone)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'mma do it 'til I get it right
I went to war last night
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I can never take the lead, I can never bob and weave
For my nigga that be letting 'em annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"

[Outro]
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give of myself again 'til the well runs dry

[Car Horns][Produced by Sounwave]

[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was Me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG, Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

[Hook + Bridge]

[Part 2]

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick A.K.A. Compton's human sacrifice

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc. Sherm sticks, butt nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time's crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of I.V.s with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

[Skit]
– Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit
– Nigga, that ain't no word
– Nigga, Shut up! Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that[Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, me and my niggas trying to get it, ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane then went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun... Forever)
And I been hustling all day, this a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with that's just how I feel
Nah nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know big balling with my homies
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirelli's skirting
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Hook]

[Bridge 2x: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough, no way
Love one of you bucket headed hoes, no way
Hit the streets, then we break the code, no way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol, no way

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
'Magine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking, blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

[Hook]

[Outro]
K’s Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren’t gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house man. This man, on one, he feeling good as a mother fucker. Shit, I’m trynna get my thing going too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him
K’s Dad: Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol’ fat ass. Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol’ fat ass

Faded (Drank) Faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me:

[Hook]
"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it"

[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Kendrick & his conscience]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me:

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Break]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out, do you bang?
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

[Hook] + [Bridge]

(Sherane)

Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger, pain, that grow insane
Tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me
Makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom
Of a bottle
And the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin'
Why you laugh?
Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Skit]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't tripping
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, aye I see somebody

[Intro]
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1]
I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

[Hook]x2
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check with all disrespect let me say this

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Outro]
Bitch don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard a chorus like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are, in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

[Verse 1]
Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

[Verse 2]
I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3]
It's go time, I roll in dough with a good grind, and I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet, they say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, it's a failure even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

[Hook]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1]
Man, I swear, my nigga trippin' off that shit again, pick him up
Then I set him in cold water, then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope to take the pain away from the feelin' that he feel today
You know, when you part of Section.80, you feel like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off my generation, sippin' cough syrup
Like it's water, never no pancakes in the kitchen, man
No wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
That the world is 'bout to end, who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream, yep
Her president is black, she black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Like whoa, ooh whoa, whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)

[Verse 2]
And then she started...
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon, oh I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23 "Okay, then we all crack babies"
Damn, why you say that? She said, "Where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors have the police relax"
I stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen; jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, read between the lines
Yep hope that I get close enough, when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up, when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy"

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Produced by Sounwave and Skhye Hutch]

[Intro/Hook]
When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope ---

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it "Section.80," the message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit, well it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite ’cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'mma get it or die trying
I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em
With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself:
Am I really scared of passing away? If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch; I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four-
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day, you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?

[Hook]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

(Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for-ooooh)

Part 2 - I'm Dying of Thirst

[Produced by Like from Pac Div]

[Verse 1]
Tired of running, tired of hunting
My own kind but retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm running out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of balling like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling, I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doing? Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lying 'bout comin'
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding, and the beef is bubblin'
It's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm running out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, are stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, are stress days
Say "Fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"

[Skit/Outro][Produced by Tabu]

[Intro]
Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
To this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans
Ya bish

Smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
‘Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If it’s necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with – look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I’m drug-free, but shit I’m with the homies

[Interlude]
(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckin’ niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like
“Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!”)

[Verse 2]
It’s 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
I’ll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we weren’t from ‘round there
‘Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile sim cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn’t like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That’s ironic ‘cause I’ve never been violent, until I’m with the homies

[Interlude]
(Just ridin’, just ridin’)
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin’, actin’ a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin’, really trippin’)
Me and the homies
(Just ridin’, just ridin’, just ridin’…)

[Verse 3]
Bragging ‘bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didn’t make me feel that bad
I’m usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain’t got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still “nigga, what is you saying”
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called – "Hello? What you doin'?" “Kicking it”
I should’ve told her I’m probably ‘bout to catch my first offense with the homies

But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

[Outro]
K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi. Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park, cause I know he trying to fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what he’s not gon' do. Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active[Produced by J. Cole]

[Intro]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiiPower

[Verse 1]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Hook]
Just call the shit HiiiPower
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

[Verse 2]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Hook]
Just call the shit HiiiPower
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

[Bridge: Alori Joh]
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na

[Verse 3]
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Hook]
Just call the shit HiiiPower
Yeah nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real

[Verse 1]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
You're living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say "Queen"
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Hook]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say, when I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air, I'm proud to say yeah
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really, really, real
I'm real, I'm real, (cause before you know it, everything's gone)

[Verse 2]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like "because"
Or the word "but," but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse ’cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse ’cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me "ball out"?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

[Voicemail: Kendrick's father]
Kenny, I ain't trippin' off them dominoes anymore. Just calling, sorry to hear what happened to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did, homie.

Alright, that's all I wanted to tell you. Just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom

[Kendrick's mother]
Boy, you better have my car on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't trippin'. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by Food for Less and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take that music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do

[Bridge]
Sing my song, it's all for you (x16)

[Voicemail Continued]
"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye."

[Intro]
Lord God
I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus name, Amen

[Verse 1]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome"
Whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancing
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearing shades now (Cool)
"Where you stay?" She said "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well is it Compton?"
"No," she replied and quickly start batting her eyes and
Strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothing but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you trying to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well

[Verse 2]
The summer had passed and now I'm liking her
Conversation we having probably enticing her
Who could imagine, maybe my actions would end up wifing her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
It's deep rooted, the music of being young and dumb
Its never muted, in fact it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang banging - did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from getting a nut
I wanna come over, what's up? That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm trying to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of being thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

[Verse 3]
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passing Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
I'm thinking bout that sex, thinking bout her thighs
Or maybe kissing on her neck, or maybe what positions next
Sent a picture of her titties blowing up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hoping to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she waving me 'cross the street
I pulled up a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

[Outro]
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick. Where you at? Damn, I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes!
I gotta go to the county buildin, man
These kids ready to eat! I’m ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what?
I hope you ain’t out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit
Especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane
Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain’t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Yo daddy hollerin' 'bout some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too, gon' 'head Kenny, gon', shit!
(Hello? Yeah, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?)
Kenny!
(What?)
You on his voicemail! Damn fool
(Oh)
Shit
(K, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I ask you to bring my fuckin' dominoes!)
Kenny give me the damn phone, shit. Don’t hang up! Damn!
(He losing my damn dominoes)
Just let me- Kendrick! When you get this message, man
Call me back. I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car
This man fussin' 'bout some damn dominoes
It ain’t all that serious. Fuck, damn dominoes
Shit I'mma miss my damn appointment! Fuck!
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
(Nobody want to hear yo' ass!
Mattafact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe[Produced By: J.LBS & T.H.C]

[Intro]
I wanna hit line drives...
Wanna lose weight and keep eating...
For you...
Hey, whats up doc?

[Bridge]
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized I-I-I had something to prove
You told me "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar and Gunplay]
And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it, (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic, (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
I run it, (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!), and I run it, (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it, (Y-Yeah! Blow!), and I run it (Yeah! Blow!) That's ironic

[Interlude]
Liberation...leader...
Popular pie plant pictured here...
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun, how come your tongue say killa then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
Living in the bottom of the food chain
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you and none do
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
That's a error, you can smell it in the air and everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
Now I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (cereal!) I ain't felt this (good since!)
Scrooge McDuck, (here we go!) Elementary hood shit

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
Even with a pot to piss in
I'mma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
Discounts never did amount to a check
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
Emerging on everbody corner (dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag with a task of a new (task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
How did I make it (past yours)
Well let me tell you like this
I've been running this shit since (I asked for it)
Cartoons and cereal

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Gunplay]
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth just for you
Mufucka hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
Friends, enemies all the same
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
Yeah this me, no mic
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain...

Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain

[Sample]
Smoking weed with you
Cause you taught me to

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
Good times to get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
I’m living but, really though, it's never enough
10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
Everybody wanna visit for (Women, weed and weather)
They come for (Women, weed and weather)
(For the women, weed and weather)
From all around the world for the (Women, weed and weather)
These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
How the fuck y'all can't see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
It's a beautiful day, I guess, for a bitch to roll with Andre, I guess
Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed

[Hook]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi Town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living

[Bridge]
Women, weed and weather
(They come for) women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Don't it sound clever, come and play
What more can I say? Welcome to LA

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, my nigga said he wanna fly out to get him
Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
Take them mothafuckin' panties off, you ain't no nun, shit
I be living in the sky everytime I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be on, to peak on the charts
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know I'm priority order me
Hennessey and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be on, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, that's me, mothafuck your opinion
Huh, how many ways am I killing 'em? Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean she'll fuck 'til the morning, time and I got time
And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything, I by that ocean
I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody fucking with this

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
They want that shit, they often fiend, I give it to 'em, but in between
My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean toward three W's in life
You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like 'em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think
I don't fuck with no hand me downs
See if you fuck then it's after me
You know how much I'mma make it work?
You know her dress slip it in her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first, Cali

[Hook + Bridge][Produced by Willie B]

[Intro]
Alright, here we go, third take. Real quick, Ali

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Bitch

[Verse 1]
And this is rigamortus and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up, if you could fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
Dead 'em all and especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I killed him
(He dead) Ha-ha (Amen) Amen

[Hook]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Bridge]
(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC, really ballistic
Anybody can see any assistance, everybody done see some persistence
Recognize I be really too vicious the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the streets, better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see, putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me, recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe is charged up and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me and y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

[Bridge + Hook + Bridge][Produced by Tommy Black]

[Hook]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with y'all
(Bitches all up in my business) I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 1]
Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas wanna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I'm here and every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up, in the building, we get busy and say
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep, R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y-A-H, give it up 2 times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Look at my life then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time'll never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Sip Don Perignon, when we finish, we say
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep, R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips, don't blow my high

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now everybody singing this shit

[Aaliyah]
I'm sending him a four-page letter, and I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him he better get it on time

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look at my life, and look at yours
Get some ambition why you bored[Produced by Sounwave]

[Bridge]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

[Hook]
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Verse 1]
Everything I do is türelem
I'mma take my time, I'mma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I've seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report
That I done you wrong, and I mean to know, my homie never
Nigga right now, it's now or never, nigga right now, I'm high as ever
But however...

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
And they wanna tell me, I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit, if he gave me a handout
I'mma take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
I remember when I came out and shit
Man, it's been so long since they see my dick
Probably been five months since I seen my seed
Goddammit, K. Dot, when it come to this?
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch
Nigga I was mothafuckin' out, yeah
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
When I should have been making bank, yeah
I was somewhere stuck where the flame is
Mothafucka, see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year (Can I get a hell yeah?)
Drop my tear, hold my joy (Show my pride)
(Music saved my fucking life, I'm doing right and you left behind)
(Feel my pain, now I'm styling, Hermès shit, I spent a thousand)
(Different homes, different islands)
Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album

[Bridge]
Reason why I'm be going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick

Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 1]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only 17
The 7 cars start honking, she start running like Flo-Jo
Don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
She give all to her daddy but she don't know her father, that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercover the dummies that look like decoys
Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
Of the black man, white man, needed satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen a El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song

[Bridge]
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, set her down and pressed play

[Hook][Intro]
Uh, shoutout to Schoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker (laughs)

[Verse]
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC Oh my God you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9's all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’mma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
And a fist full of money give it to a fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJ’s
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
Get it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no Calico
Go pop some pills or something
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And a medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck![Intro: Beyoncé]
Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
And the missing love that's misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces, chuck the D'usse
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tatts, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's 'til the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this Tec, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Deeper then words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

[Bridge]

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
(Without you I got nothing to lose)[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)
You curse my name, in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you, I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud, the next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair, sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
Goddammit it I like it
Bright lights is enticing but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me, what I do, I took her back
Fool me twice that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame, Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
And we all just entertainers

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body, psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk, see 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though, I'm getting high, sitting low
Sliding by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain worse, I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with, nigga deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snapping, my eyes hurt, niggas dying back where
I was birthed, fuck your iris and the IRS, get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours, why you mad?
Take the good with the bad, or throw the baby out with that bath water

[Bridge: Jay Z]
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga you survived, you still getting bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive, Michael Jackson's Thriller

[Hook]

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart, just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much

[Hook][Intro]
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass

[Hook]
Tom Ford, Tom Ford, Tom Ford

[Bridge]
Coming up, coming down
Riding clean fix your hair in my Crown
Bad bitch, H town
Keep it trill, y'all know y'all can't fuck around

[Verse 1]
Paris where we been, pard' my Parisian
It's Hov time in no time, it's fuck-all-y'all season
Piss Bordeaux and Burgundies, flush out a Riesling
When Hov's out, them hoes out, y'all put y'all weaves in, and
Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass
Spent all my euros on tuxes and weird clothes
I party with weirdos, yeah Hov, yeah Hov

[Hook]
I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford
International bring back the Concorde
Numbers don't lie, check the scoreboard

Tom Ford, Tom Ford, Tom Ford

[Verse 2]
Hands down got the best flow, sound I'm so special
Sound boy burial, this my Wayne Perry flow
Y'all know nothing 'bout Wayne Perry though
District of Columbia, guns on y'all Tumblrs
Fuck hashtags and retweets, nigga
140 characters in these streets, nigga
Pardon my laughing, y'all only flagging on beats, nigga
Pardon my laughing, I happen to think you sweet

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Oh, man, so throwed

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Hold up (I don't pop molly, I rock Tom Ford)[Intro: Pimp C]
"A little over a year ago I was in bondage, and now I'm back out here reaping the blessings and getting the benefits that go along with it, everything that's out here for kings like us. The reason why we like this, this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff, they don't understand is, because we really from Africa, and that's where all this stuff come from. And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying? So don't look down on the youngsters because they wanna have shiny things. It's in our genes, know what I'm saying? We just don't all know our history, so—"

[Hook: Rick Ross]
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it
Come fuck with me, you know I got it

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I just landed in Europe, nigga
Shopping bags, I'm a tourist, nigga
Money talk I speak fluent, nigga
Reeboks on, I just do it, nigga
Look at me, I'm pure nigga
I bet the hoes on my tour, nigga
I don't bop, I do the money dance
My bitch whip cost a hundred grand
Red vert, you see me slide
Sexy bitch I hope she 'bout it
Sexy bitch I know she 'bout it
Fuck with me, you know I got it

[Hook: Rick Ross]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Hov just landed in Rome, nigga
All hail, Caesar's home, niggas
Cent'anni, ciao bella
Come money dance with the good fellas
Hov keep gettin' that dinero, got it
Even if a nigga gotta Robert, get it?
Black Jack in a casino
A nigga got unlimited credit
A nigga got a lot of vendettas
But we the Black mob, we gonna set it
Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach
200 in the dash we gonna rev it (skirt)
Lucky Luciano is what they call me, paesano
A 100 keys at the piano plays across the Verrazano
El Padrino, in the villa in Venice sipping vino
Not bad for a mulignan
Y'all know like we know, I got it

[Hook: Jay-Z]

[Outro: Rick Ross]
I'm riding big coming down that beach
Geechi niggas with satin sheets
Bad bitch, she a masterpiece
Got a bad bitch, she a master; peace[Produced by Purpdogg]

[Intro: Eastbound & Down (Kenny Powers)]
The only thing I'm seein' I'd like to put an amend on, perhaps a little more room here for the fixins, you know what I'm talkin' about? Oh, we gon' have a lot of fixins? We gonna have so many fuckin' fixins up in this motherfucker, this shit gon' go through the roof. Oh God damn I'm shittin' gold these days

[Soulja Boy]
We made it
We made it

[Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
The devil, the haters, the bloggers
The papers, the labels, they labeled me
But they can't relate to our struggle, my nigga
We came up from slavery
Apologies go out to all of my fans cause they waited so patiently
This one is for all of the lost and forgotten black angels that prayed for me
A milli, a milli, niggas love me cause I'm ill
The greatest story ever told, niggas in the field
From Solomon to Sambo to Django, it's fact
I'm the Farrakhan of rap and I get it from the wheel
The son of WD, who hung around in the D
Who ran around in the three
The trap gods raised me
Face all on the Sphinx
Story all in the wall of the pyramids
Niggas know the Black God saved me
You can blow the nose off, that won't change it
Obamacare won't heal all that anguish
We came a long way from the bottom of the boat
All praise to the Mahdi, we found our language
Gold necklace, middle finger erected
God tribe of Shabazz stylin' on the record
Lost sons of Muhammad, we wildin' in the wreckage
Asha du illah illaha is the message
All these niggas, I got to fight one
All these devils, I got to strike some
All these rebels just waitin' on the war cry
Mama said: "son, you got to strike drum"
Roc Nation, celebration
Motivation, elevation
Nigga we made it from slaves on a slaveship
Live from the cotton fields, straight to the spaceship

[Interlude: Kenny Powers]
Kinda makes me wonder why the hell so many people are tryna tell me to slow down. Seems like motherfuckers should be shuttin' the hell up and enjoyin' the show

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Hop off the slave ship
Popped off my chain and took it to Jacob, I got it gold plated
Walked in that bitch like "Nigga we made it!"
I own my own masters
You know I ain't missin' no royalty statements
I can't be rated (God, God), damn Hov stunt on them haters
Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk
Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought
While these rappers rap about guns they ain't shot
And a bunch of other silly shit that they ain't got
I'm on my Lupita Nyong'o
Stuntin' on stage, after 12 Years A Slave
This Ace of Spades look like an Oscar
Black tux, look like a mobster
Don't make me RRRRAA yah, nigga watch your tone
I come to court with black boxers on
Y'all hella jealous of my melatonin
I could black out at any given moment
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made
So when my arms & feet shackled I still get paid
All praises due
I'm ready to chase the Yakub back into caves
These are the last days, but do I seem fazed?
Showed up to the last supper in some brand new J's
I'm the true and livin', book of Hov
New religion, 8th wonder of the world, alien, superstition
You're blind, baby
Blind to the fact of who you are maybe
My bloodline's crazy
Kings and queens and Michael Jordan rings
I go stupido, sucio
The flow is filthy, y'all can't kill me
I've been inoculated from the snakes and the fakes
The corny handshakes, cock sucker we made it[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to DeNiro, but I’ll be hood forever
I’m the new Sinatra and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonalds
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons whipping pastry
Cruising down 8th street, off-white Lexus
Driving so slow but BK is from Texas
Me I’m out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sipping mai tais
Sitting courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga I be Spiked out, I can trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from...

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
New York, concrete jungle where dreams are made
There's nothing you can’t do
Now you’re in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
You're welcome OG, I made you hot, nigga

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rocks
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
8 million stories out there in the naked City
It's a pity half of y’all won’t make it
Me I gotta plug Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jeezy's paying LeBron, I’m paying Dwyane Wade
3 dice Cee-lo, 3 card Marley
Labor Day Parade, rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World trade
Long live the king, yo; I’m from the Empire State, that's:

[Hook]

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
That boy good...
Welcome to the bright light, baby

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick
The side lines is lined with casualties
Who sip the life casually, then gradually become worse
Don’t bite the apple, Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with 'em
Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
"Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can’t save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Hook]

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say: "yeah!"

[Hook][Verse 1]
You know I, thug em, fuck em, love em, leave em
Cause I don't fucking need em
Take em out the hood, keep em looking good
But I don't fucking feed em
First time they fuss I'm breezing
Talking bout, what's the reasons
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust and believe em
In the cut where I keep em
Til I need a nut, til I need to beat the guts
Then it's "beep beep" and I'm picking them up
Let em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'mma break bread
So you can be living it up
Shit I, part with nothing, y'all be fronting
Me give my heart to a woman
Not for nothing, never happen
I'll be forever macking
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion, I got no patience
And I hate waiting, ho get your ass in and let's ride

[Hook]
We doing: big pimping, we spending cheese (Check 'em out now)
Big pimping on B.L.A.D.E's
We doing big pimping up in N.Y.C
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Nigga it's the big Southern rap impresario
Coming straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's my scenario
No I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointing - they say, "There he go!"
Now these motherfuckers know we carry more heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up your vocab
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us coming down on your SLAB
Living ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hating I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked. Just break it
You gotta pay like you weigh: wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flying to the track
Timbaland let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breaking these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flow's on
But when shit get hot, then the Glock start popping like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger man
Don't trip, let's flip, getting throwed on the flip
Getting blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool

[Hook 2]
We doing: big pimping, we spending cheese (Check 'em out now)
Big pimping on B.L.A.D.E's
We doing big pimping up in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Smoking out, pouring up, keeping lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all
If I wasn't rapping baby, I would still be riding Mercedes
Chroming, shining, sipping daily, no rest until whitey pay me
Uhhh, now what y'all know bout them Texas boys
Coming down in candied toys, smoking weed and talking noise

[Hook 2]

[Jay-Z Alt. Verse]
On the canopy, my stamina be, enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick then back to the streets but
Still sitting on blades... sipping that ray
Standing on the corner of my block hustling
Still getting that cane
Half what I paid slipping right through customs
It'll sell by night its egg shell white
I got so many grams if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimping, spending cheese
With B.U.N. B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck, laughing it up
Jigga Man: that's what's upHit ya ass on the celly, cause I ain't got time
To be arguing with your ass, if you ain't really ready
Girl why you never ready for as long as you took
You better look like Halle Berry...or Beyoncé
Shit then we getting married
I brought sand to the beach cause my beach is better
You can keep ya beach cause that beach whatever
Started out at The Darby, ended up at 1 Oak
Left the house with 100 grand, ended up near broke
Don't get mad at me, I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's gone I'm like fuck it, I replace it with another one
Can't take this money with you
Burn this shit up like I'm Richard
Niggas asking is the oven on[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Hook - Jay-Z]
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 1]
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We should've been together having Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town, somewhere locking a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
On repeat, the CD of BIG's "Me and My Bitch"
Watching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand saying, "Let me see that clip"
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fussy and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then
You have given away without getting at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga living was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I mourn forever, shit
I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

[Hook][Produced by Rick Rubin]

[Hook]
If you're having girl problems I feel bad for you, son
I've got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads, fuckers
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfucking law
Got two choices y'all, pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryna see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road, I heard
"Son do you know why I'm stopping you for"
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir, I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"Well you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are"
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my paper's legit
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack
You some type of lawyer or something
Somebody important or something"
Well, I ain't passed the bar but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come"
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one, hit me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is
I'm-a get to clapping and
He and his boys gonna be yapping to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratching again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snapping em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassing them
Tryna play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothing sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, being a bitch ain't one, hit me

[Hook]

[Outro]
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing
What I do, through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade, you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters and they live with they Moms
Got dropped roadsters from botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around
Now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without riding round
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you're worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with em a minute
Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference: they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment, nah nah
That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I don't think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go, he's {*Jigga j-Jigga*}
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, it's just the

[Hook: Eminem and Jay Z]
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
About anything, anything, anything, anything, renegade
Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade, never been afraid to holler
About anything (etc.)

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollering, gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver
Durag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me, and often, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown, especially on nights
I brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raising green up
Raising my fingers to critics
Raising my head to the sky B.I.G. I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
As a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat; who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do, I'm just a kid from the gutter
Making this butter off these bloodsuckers
Cause I'm a muthafuckin'

[Hook][Intro]
(You see this motherfucking face)
Blessings, blessings, yeah, I see..

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat dock in front of Hermes picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling Opus
Welcome to the magnum opus, the Magna Carta
The best-selling author Decoded
On the holiday playing "Strange Fruit"
If I'mma make it to a billi I can't take the same route
Swoosh, that's the sound of the border
Swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11

[Hook][Produced by Kanye West & No I.D]

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it coming in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind is who's gonna run this town tonight
Is who's gonna run this town tonight
We gonna run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars
All black everything
And our girls are blackbirds riding with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talking 5 comma, 6 zeroes, dot zero, here Doug
Back to running circles round niggas
Now we squared up, hold up

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don’t care
So I keep doing my own thing
Walking tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind is who’s gonna run this town tonight
Hey (etc.)
Who’s gonna run this town tonight

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader
So Eric B we are Microphone fiend
This the return of the God, Peace, God
Ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table screaming, "fuck the other side, they're jealous!"
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spending no cake
They should throw their hand in cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is looking like millionaires' row

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick...no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church, please: no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for to push a fuckin' Rav 4?!
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gonna want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gonna come is it's good when I'm cumming
She got an ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ah, 2 bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just trying to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
"What's that, Ye?" "Baby, these heels"
"Is that a May-what?" "Baby, these wheels"
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feeling like you running huh? Now you know how we feel[Talking: Jay-Z]
Uhh uhh uhh
You ready B? Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin down the Westside Highway
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel, it's trippy how hard
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B

[Hook]
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping
That ain't 'bout nothing - if ever you mad about something
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you working that Hermes Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Hook]

[Beyoncé]
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em, B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Jay-Z]
This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records

[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH—not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, "No One Can Do it Better"
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homey Strick told me, "Dude finish your breakfast"
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors {*laughing*}
This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit)

[Interlude: Just Blaze]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Thing ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my "by any means" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

Now, back to our regularly scheduled program, L'Album Noir: The Black Album[Produced By: Mark the 45 King]

[Hook]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us!
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standing on the corners boppin'
To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleeing the murder scene
You know me well...
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mama rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2, y'all niggas get ready

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out; all my niggas
Locked down in the ten by four, controlling the house
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision mama
I put my money on the longshots, all my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'mma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleeping on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit!
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improving
I'm tryna murder everything moving, feel me?!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it, 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Hook][Intro: Jay Z]
It was all good just a week ago
Had this all good just a week ago

[Interlude: Too $hort]
Last week I had everything
I had the money, had the cars, the bitches, and the jewelry
And then my motherfucking niggas started snitching
Beyotch!

[Verse 1]
Growing up in the hood just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems: I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him, unlock doors off my keys
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially
Man he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talking reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said, "Damn dogg, what, 9 weeks and you're home?"
He said: "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home"
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
The crackers up there bleaching your dome, you're reaching
I said: "The world don't stop, I've got to keep.. keep on"
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side when they catch a new case
It's on

[Hook]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago)

Funny what 7 days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 2]
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar now you crying for bail
Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill
I could bail out and blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinking I was from Uptown for real
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezing on them corners, still holding my crack
Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said: "I'm never going back"
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We s'posed to cock the Ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry
That's right, the same game that make you math could make you die
It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up like, "This is my dad?"
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars

[Hook]

[Too Short]
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitching
We was one step away from taking this crack money
And recycling it through the ghettoes
And building back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitching on each other
I got partners doing 15-20
Wouldn't have been doing SHIT if you didn't snitch
Beyotch! It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game and don't snitch
It sure will do a lot for you, believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house main
You know I got it, got it going on, we got the money
Ain't got nothing to do with crime, baby
But I'm recognizing

[Jay-Z]
You rat bastard![Produced by Timbaland]

[Verse 1]
I just want a Picasso in my casa, no, my castle
I'm a hassa, no, I'm an asshole
I'm never satisfied, can't knock my hustle
I wanna Rothko, no, I want a brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million
In a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling
All for the love of drug dealing
Marble floors, gold ceilings
Oh, what a feeling, fuck it, I want a billion
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I wanna row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma

[Hook]
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso baby

[Verse 2]
It ain't hard to tell, I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me throning at the Met
Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Cause I be going ape at the auction
Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go 'head, lean on that shit Blue, you own it

[Hook]

[Break]

[Woman]
"Et là je t'ai tout donné, montré, rien à cacher, tu es là Ivy, comme le nombre d'or. Jay, comment tu dis nombre d'or?"

[Jay Z]
"The golden number."

[Woman]
"Touché."

[Verse 3]
I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but
Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like, "Old man, just stop"
I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon take for me to go
For you to see, the modern day Pablo, Picasso baby[Produced by Kanye West]

[Hook]
R.O.C., we running this rap shit
Memphis Bleek, we running this rap shit
B. Mac, we running this rap shit
Freeway, we run this rap shit
O & Sparks, we running this rap shit
Chris & Neef, we running this rap shit
("Watch out!! We run New York")

[Verse 1]
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
God MC - me - Jay-hova
Hey lil soldier, you ain't ready for war
R.O.C. too strong for y'all
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight, pen to a test
Your chest in the line of fire with your thin-ass vest
You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gonna win?
This is grown man B.I., get you rolled into triage, bi-atch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny
Your peeps ain't strong enough, fucker
Roc-A-Fella is the army - better yet - the navy!
Niggas'll kidnap your babies, spit at your lady
We bring knife to fistfight, kill your drama
We kill you motherfucking ants with a sledgehammer
Don't let me do it to you, dunny, cause I overdo it
So you won't confuse it with "just rap music"

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I don't care if you Mobb Deep, I hold triggers to crews
You little fuck, I got money stacks bigger than you
When I was pushing weight, back in '88
You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped "Shook Ones," switched your demeanour
Well - we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella, students of the game, we passed the class cause
Nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let em gas you, like "Jigga is ass and won't clap you"
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole
No, you're not on my level get your brakes tweaked
I sold what your whole album sold in my first week
You guys don't want it with Hov
Ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov, no!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know you missing Nas all the (fame)
But along with celebrity comes about 70 shots to your frame, nigga
You a (lame)
You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash
Had a spark when you started but now you're just garbage
Fell from "top 10" to "not mentioned at all"
To your bodyguard's "Oochie Wally"'s verse better than yours
Matter of fact you had the worst flow on the whole fucking song
But I know: the sun don't shine, then son don't shine
That's why your (lame) career's come to an end
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Nigga, you ain't live it
You witnessed it from your folks' pad
You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC, on tour with Large Professor
Then I heard your album about your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song
And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was getting fucked then
I know who I paid, God - Serchlite publishing
Use your (brain)
You said you've been in this 10, I've been in it 5 - smarten up, Nas
4 albums in 10 years, nigga? I could divide
That's one every...let's say 2
2 of them shits was due
1 was "nah," the other was Illmatic
That's a one-hot-album-every-10-year average
And that's so (lame)
Nigga, switch up your flow
Your shit is garbage
What you trying to kick, knowledge?
You niggas gonna learn to respect the king
Don't be the next contestant on that Summer Jam screen
Because you-know-who did you-know-what with you-know-who
But let's keep that between me and you (for now)

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
A wise man told me don't argue with fools
Cause people from a distance can't tell who is who
So stop with that childish shit, nigga I'm grown
Please leave it alone - don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you
I don't know why your advisers ain't forewarn you
Please, not Jay, he's not for play
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rapping and gimmicks
I will end it, all that yapping be finished
You are not deep, you made your bed now sleep
Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you
Nigga I know you well, all the stolen jew-els
Twinkletoes, you're breaking my heart
You can't fuck with me - go play somewhere, I'm busy
And all you other cats throwing shots at Jigga
You only get half a bar - fuck y'all niggas[Produced by Eminem and Luis Resto]

[Hook]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty - the world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt - y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 1]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like "damn, that man's face is just like my face"
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homey you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Music business hate me cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell "holla"
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be
Lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' - I ain't been rhyming like Common since
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception. Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homey and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them
(rims, that is)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My homey Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, cause I really been there before
4 scores and 7 years ago prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though
These words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me nigga, scars will scab
What, you gonna box me homey? I can dodge a jab
3 shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa][Intro: 2 Chainz]
Yeah birthday, it's your birthday
If I die bury me inside that Louis store

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
When I die, bury me inside the Gucci store
When I die, bury me inside the Louis store
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho
All I want for my birthday is a big booty ho

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
She got a big booty so I call her Big Booty
Scrr..Scrr.. wrists moving, cooking, getting to it
I'm in the kitchen, yams everywhere
Just made a juug, I got bands everywhere
You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt, hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm balling, you in will call
When I die, bury me inside the jewelry store
When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, two everything I'm too different
So when I die, bury me next to two bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]
It's your birthday, it's your birthday
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place
Bad bitch contest, you in first place
I show up with a check to your work place
(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seeing from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl
I might switch it up and get your girl

[Hook]

[Outro: 2 Chainz (Kanye West)]
Deuce and Ye

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
.454, I pull up on niggas, I tell 'em lets get it
Niggas they talkin' on Twitter, you niggas you know you gon get it
Benjamin Franklin, niggas know that I keep it 100
Got me a new clip for my .223 and that bitch hold a hundred
I'm still in the hood, I got me a check and I don't want no Nike's
Bitches, they suckin', and fuckin', they do everything except bite it
I can go slow like an old man, I can go fast like I got nitrous
Spent 20 racks for my brother's appeal and I ain't talkin' no Vicodin
Over 1 mil in this room, bitch, I kinda sound like a Pisces
Lil bitch you know I'm the bomb and 2 Chainz the light, no lightnin'
Wow, these bitches excited, me and Thugger, we 'bout to start up a riot
I ain't got no pussy all week, I'm on that "bitch, suck my dick" diet

[Hook: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
Monica, come home to me, yea come home to me my dear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Teresea, I'm tired of lookin' bae, I'm into you, your rear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
Ain't nothin' special man, I sold it all yester'
Pull in Phipps Plaza in a motherfuckin' Tesla
Ain't no pressure when you got a little extra
Put them beams on your face, have 'em lookin' like freckles
Dammit man, I do not no talk but no heavens sentMy bitch pussy wet like it's wetting rain
This bitch clap on me while I clap at mans, woah
Got Balenciaga's I ain't even wore yet
Half a pound of gas I ain't smoke yet
Traphouse filled up with Ziploc
Used to give my living room super big lots
In a strip club with some flip-flops
Thought it's the time, baby it's not
Got a lotta windows on my crib, nigga
Bout to put that motherfucker in a tint shop

[Hook: Young Thug + 2 Chainz]
PART 2: Lil Boy[Produced by J Gramm]

[Interlude]
Who killed little boy, who killed little boy?
Rat infested hallways, no escape, no escape
From misery, no way out from that hell

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
I'm bout to give these niggas what they ask for
I used to have to argue with my land lord
Yea, my nickname is Tity Boi
Bitch gotta have at least a handful
All my cribs came with a damn pool
Used to stash work in my camel
Young 6'5" with the handle
If you don't watch Atlanta then you need to turn the channel
See I pull up in this bitch in a Phantom
Front grill looking like it's dancin' (it is)
Put some stacks on your head little boy (lil boy)
Yeah they 'bout to call you the grandson (lil boy)
Pussy nigga gonna need a tampon (lil boy)
Put rifle bullets in a handgun (lil boy)
Keep a bankroll on me, nigga
By the time I eat some bacon I got bands on
All my cars I done put rims on 'em
I done touched down, no end zone
All that bitch do is run her mouth, nigga
On the right but that bitch got a Sprint phone
Man she got about 100 acres
Enough yard for me to put a couple Benz's on
And I just pop me a perc
I might fuck that bitch with my Timbs on
(Truuuuuu)[Hook]
Mustard on the beat, ho!
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing
Middle finger up to my competition
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
I'm different, yeah I'm different
Pull up to the scene with my ceiling missing

[Verse 1]
Pull up to the scene, but my roof gone
When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song
2 Chainz but I got me a few on
Everything hot, skip lukewarm
Tell shawty to bust it open, Uncle Luke on
Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping
I don't feel good, but my trigger happy
But the stripper happy, but they wish they had me
And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I fucked her so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big, I told her to look back at it
Look back it, look back it
Then put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic
I am so high...attic
I am so high like an...addict

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly
I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly
I put it straight in her belly
When it go in the belly, it ain't shit you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
I paid a thousand dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a 100k for a feature
Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, so get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck

[Hook][Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit ya ass with that block-ow, dope enough to go in yo nostrils
I take ya girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead ass rappers
It's probably one these pussy ass niggas, don’t try me I’ll pull that trigga
Got ya car note in my cup, and your rent in my swisha
That pussy so good I miss you, head game’s so vicious
And all I get is cheese like I’m taking pictures

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, less I’m with you
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss you
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie
You ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million fore they die
Wattup

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true, that’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out
And I say damn that makes two of us
Aww that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s whats her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talking they'll confirm
Go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keeping my cup full
So I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
We don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some
I’ll out rap his ass, out trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take him out, bring em in, them whole things
2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t
Went where they say I couldn’t (tru)
YSL belt buckle, ya’ll niggas sure is looking
Ya’ll niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy!

[Hook][Intro]
>What is it?
>Freebase
>What's free about it?

I thought if I said now, “Listen"
"Should I talk about freebase and what it"--or somethin?
And people say, "Well, no, because, then people will start doin' it"
No, let me--I gotta talk about what happened to me

[Bridge]
See where we're from, it's all or nothing
But we take penitentiary chances like it's nothing
We came from nothing, from nothing
Freebase on top of the oven, get money my type of discussion
Ya'll could do this shit for free, a nigga like me gon' be hustlin'
Freebase (x9)

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I came from nothing
Me and my niggas, we came from nothing, sold that caine like it’s nothing
Told you from the introduction I came from the pain and suffering
Two pit bulls and a TEC-9, TEC-9 use to jam up on me all the time
Swear to god if you come up in my mama yard
I’mma shoot that motherfucker till it get tired
Big dually truck got six tires, big ties when I rhyme mixtapes
And I keep shitting on the competition, I'm about to put out me out a shit tape
Guess we ain't playin' by no rules, every night I freestyle on Pro Tools
Tell Flex come to the A we'll carjack him by one of them regular ass old schools
I don't respect my elders, these right here Maison Margiela
I cannot get no earrings, it'll make my Rolex jealous
I been a felon since fifteen, my expedition had a big screen
Half you niggas was constipated, half you niggas wasn't shit then
Zone one all the way to zone six, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own shit
Fuck y'all, I'll buy my own whip, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own brick
Tell them pussy niggas that ain't pay shit "Better be ready to let the gat loose"
I done did a song with everybody from Jermaine Dupri down to Papoose

[Hook]
I came from nothing (x6)

[Verse 2]
Work hard, play hard, work hard again
My bankroll had twins, can you comprehend?
Seafood lover, I don't eat pork
Used to hit them J's like a 3-point, my partner mascot is a pitchfork
And you already know what this for - me too, rent due
Doggin' these hoes like a shih tzu so cold I recorded in a igloo
Nigga asked me why I don't drink, man, let me tell you what the wine do
My partner came in and said "This my girl", I had to tell that motherfucker "Mine too!"
Court dates in the summertime, might pull up in a vert
No matter what the charges is, I'mma pull off with a smirk
This right here for Old Nat, this right here for Godby Road
This right here for Riverdale, trappin' at the Stop-N-Go
Trappin' at the Texaco, it was Amaco before it was BP
My plug from Mexico, he fell out when he seen me on TV
Sold drugs to my loved ones and it's hard for me to admit it
The first time I've seen a crack pipe was in my parents' kitchen

[Hook][Intro: Pharrell & 2 Chainz]
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Ain't no such thing as tomorrow
The way we living today

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Dreads hang on designer everything
Mr. Comme des Garçons, Mr. Alexander Wang
Mr. Chain, pinky ring, flow insane, ho insane
Man, these shoes I got on, these the hardest I've done seen
It look clean when you pour it; I remix it make it dirty
If she got good head and text me I text back and tell her "hurry"
This that category 5 when I walk up in the strip club
Throw it high, make you and George Washington head butt
OG's never fed us, now young niggas fed up
Ballin' so hard I deserve a and one
Baking soda marketing, I'm getting it ain't I? Obviously
You a bitch, you a ho, that's just my philosophy
And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team
Billie Jean red leather same color Red Lobster
And she brain wash ya -- head doctor
I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching

[Hook x2: 2 Chainz & Pharrell]
I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
I'mma be fresh as hell if the Feds watching
Drop top, head bopping

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Grams to Grammys, two guns Yosemite
Niggas put their Glock on your ass, fuck that Heather B
Pumping that amphetamine, all this D I'm peddling
I be somewhere settling, somewhere that you have never been
To the top you never been, you might need a respirator
Money on the rise like I'm counting on an elevator
You gon' need a detonator swimming with them barracudas
Close the docket on that ma'fucka prosecutor
This Armani, this Givenchy, I parachute you
I'm so fly I jumped out the air wearing Gucci (Tell 'em!)
I'm raw, talking California Rolls
Smoking California weed with California hoes (Truu!)
Sending flicks to my partners in the state pen
I just got some pants made out of snake skin
See them shades you got on called Ray-Bans
And the shades I got on cost eight bands (damn)

[Hook][Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I keep my hoes in check, you buy Nike for yours
Say they want that loud, I'mma bring that noise
Check my watch on a flight, yeah, I call that airtime
Murk 'em in the middle of the street, that gon' be his deadline
Yeah, you gon' respect mine, got a body on my Tec-9
Say you nobody 'till somebody gon' body you, flatline
Pocket full of dead guys and you know I'm anti
Anti-social, anti-lame, but ain't I cool nigga, ain't I?
You looking at a star that's spaced out
Trying to take my style then take off
I go to work with no days off, everything all paid off
Shawty pussy hair shaved off and she did it just for me, nigga
Would skip you like a spacebar, but I much rather delete niggas

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I been getting money, where the fuck you been? (x4)
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in (x3)
I been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Gucci hat (Gucci hat), Gucci belt
If you wrote a autobiography, you'd have to sue yourself
Yo' lying ass, codeine in my wine glass
I know you had a wild past, I ain't fucked you in a while with yo' wild ass
I get high and I fly past, I don't know nothing 'bout iChat
I'm working this iPhone, they need an app called iTrap
I trap, shining like a night lamp
I just hit my girlfriend and asked her where her wife at
White cup, white hat, laying on a white couch
Got that presidential in a residential white house
Nigga saying "who?" (who) like a white owl
You can see me shinin' (shinin') with the light out, come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cap-1]
Turn five to a ten to a twenty to fifty
To hundred, my niggas get money, I want it
Ride through the city, my niggas got choppers
My bitch, she's so pretty, that's my Pocahontas
Everything on me, I shine like a trophy
Run up a check while they watch out for police
Versace my pinky, a brick on my Rollie
That Cali Ferrari, I'm feeling like Kobe
T-R-U, that's to the death of me, nigga
Killers on the right and left of me, nigga
My destiny, nigga, to get all this money
I can't, I can't share that whole recipe with ya
My nigga told me "Get 'em, get it?" I got 'em
Stand on that couch and just drink out the bottle
That .40 got hollows, that bitch, she gon' swallow
Get to that money, I'm King of Chicago
Bought a new crib just to fuck you in
Bought that Benz just to fuck your friends
Giuseppe's 900 with the gold bars
Everything about me raw like a dope charge

[Hook][Intro]
Mama, MAMA!
(Wha, What!)
You get that money out my pants last night?
(Boy! Naw I ain't get no money out yo pants! And quit yellin' at me!!)
Ain't nobody hollin' at you!

I had a dream that rap wouldn't work
I woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold (x5)

[Verse 1]
I got Medusa on my sneakers
My dick up like "nice to meet ya"
100K for a feature, hundred K's at my leisure
Then we aim at your people
I be higher than a eagle
When I'm sipping on that codeine
Free my nigga Sigel
Ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flexin' ghostas
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some
I'm all that and then some, my trap house is my income
And it's booming

[Hook]
I had a dream, rap wouldn't work
Woke up on the block, hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold (x3)

[Verse 2]
2 Chainz!
I'm ballin' like Mr. Clean
I gotta keep my kitchen clean
God bless me like I'm finna sneeze
Doctor weigh me on a triple beam
D-boy in parenthesis
All gold in my amenities
2 Chainz, two pinky rings
My trigger finger's like a lemon squeeze (Baow!)
Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked
And my vision is Pyrex
I do it big like a 5X
Killed they ass with the eyepatch
I got bad bitches on my side
I done fucked around and got sidetracked
My first night, I spent five stacks
Next night I forgot to count
I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out?
I'm the fireman, I put fire out
Got a pole in my basement
Tipped your girl like Maliah now
Ridin' on these motherfucka's until they blow my tires out, uh

[Bridge]
My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, wrist?"
My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like "What up, stove?"
All this jewelry on then I'm out cold
So much money on me, it won't even fold!

I shoulda got me a plaque, I should get me more attention
No, you should shut the fuck up and leave all the bitchin' to bitches
(Wuda cuda shuda ass nigga, ol' wuda, cuda)
(Wuda cuda shuda ass nigga, ol' ol', ol')

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
She in stilettos, she walkin’ all pigeon toed
Really though, when it come to gettin’ dough
If you listen to me, I’m so underground
You have to sit on the floor, oh!
I just thought I’d seen a spaceship, ride right past my airline
Everybody know I dumps that white girl like Kevin Federline
Don’t pay me no nevermind
These niggas is buggin’, pesticide
I count money in my spare time
Just paid a hundred dollars for a hairline
Label talkin’ bout what they woulda did
Bet they hustle me and you could be a winner
Girl, you eat more pussy than me
Girl, you shoulda been a nigga
Pockets swellin' up like Lymph nodes
Been a go-getter from the get go
Always talkin' bout what you was finna do
Damn broad, thought that you were finna get dough!

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
You a wuda, cuda, shuda ass hater
Wanna be a man so bad homie
Ain't wanna see me get free
If you could you would have caught the stand on me
If I would have shook your hand, I would have been your boy
Now you extra hot since I dun' hit your broad
Now you talkin' now, 'bout sparkin' now
You prolly would shoot somethin' if you had some heart
That Bentley come from exotic rentals
Gotta go back Sunday, so you flat broke Monday
Probably could go spend 200 on somethin'
If you was gettin' Boosie money
You in King of Diamonds throwin' counterfeit
You might as well gon' pussy pop on the stage
All these rappers lyin' on records
O-M-G Hip-Hop, Hooray!
And you probably woulda been up in my video
But that was 'fore I went in
Ain't even write me no letter
You a wuda, shuda, cuda ass friend, busta!

[Hook + Bridge][Hook: 2 Chainz]
Thank God for the first nigga started trapping
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em
I got a problem with these niggas
I got a problem with these bitches
Trigger finger keep itchin'
I pull it, I do it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflage down put your camera phone down
If she got an ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'mma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa

[Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em come to the crib and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
Tunechi...

[Drake]
That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up
It's just me and 2 Chainz, but the chain's never tucked though
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga fuck y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Well, if you know like I know that pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than the snot nose, man all these hoes is my hoes
If she bougie fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend
Don’t cross that line its paper thin
High as a star, make a wish
I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch

[2 Chainz]
You hate that bitch, well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you’re riding on your skateboard
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib
Man fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat
I am so cold I need a cover and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Outro]
Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3
Right now it's me time
A little time for myself, me time
Oh yeah, right now it's me time
Don't want no one else now, me time
Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone
Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone
Please, please don't stop by my home
No, no cause I feel it's just matter of time
Till you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind
Right now it's me time
You need to go kick rocks now
Me time[Produced by Metro Boomin and 808 Mafia]

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money machine at the bank, I just made me a deposit
Fucked that bitch right on the sink
Is it the pussy or is it the faucet?
I just left the hotel, never let ho in mi casa
All this designer shit it's like a crib in my closet
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
Man, all this fuckin' gear it's like a crib in my closet
My Nike shoebox filled with rubber bands
That mean my Nike shoebox is my ATM
Fuck it, I said it, I'm winning, downsouth MC Ren
I might buy some Timbs, or peanut butter MCM
Raised down the street from a crack house
Pull her hair weave 'til the track out
Treat the rap game like a trap game
Tryna make a yellow ho tap out
I got Dolce, I ain't even worn yet, codeine ain't even po' yet
I could spend millions of dollars, and still won't even be poor yet
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking poet, riding now, motherfucker Ol'Nat
A nigga wearing a Versace shirt, man that's a motherfucking throwback

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
I got a crib in my closet, got a crib in my closet
All designer shit, I got a crib in my closet

All designer shit, all designer shit, I got a crib in my closet, bitch

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Since rappin' turn to fashion, I don't know what happen

Picture poles and tactics
Ho this that click click, finna' blow this backwards
Money, hoes and fabrics
Strolling past like ''fuck yo photo caption''
If ye ain't got it then you bragging, that's automatic

Got Prada around from 1999 and shit, bet you won't find the shit
I’m on my Anna shit, that’s Wintour

Got a crib in my closet, Spanish chick in my casa
So much space in my closet, fit your crib in my closet

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I got more sneakers than niggas, over 4000 pairs
Most all white like the Rhode Island mayor

You smell like pork in Mecca, Lord be my protector
Second row at the fight, bitch get on my level
Larry Merchant my nigga, I got Holyfield money
Finger your girl at Coachella, gotta roll in that for me
You should see me in Lennox, I shop ‘til I drop
Spent so much on the watch, had a seizure and shock
Wake up and ball, watch how I walk
Money all on my mind, call 'em lucrative thoughts

Chance of that is unlikely; 2 Chainz in my white T
I wipe her down and I pipe her down, I give my girl money to go out of town
You give your girl money to go to Niketown and I one-night her, you must like her
Kill niggas with one-liners, all I need is one lighter
Counting so much money (so much money), I got arthritis
So cold I frostbite 'em, no Pig Latin but I hog-tied 'em
If she gets this business then I {make her fall in love}
With a nigga like me I’m killing this beat - skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet on my sheets
On top, from the back, I thundercat like (HOE!)
My girl got a big purse with a purse in it
And her pussy so clean I can go to church in it!
Oh Lord, O-M-G, I am the O-N-E

'Best believe I'm just slidin' through
Put your panties to the side let me slide through

White coupe, with the white rims

Nighttime, mouth look like a sunny day
I'm in a new whip switchin' every other lane
While you walkin down the street switchin every other way

Walking around campus at break time
Niggas saying he's back like a Mace line
There was bitches there thicker than a steak fry
But I couldn't get head on FaceTime
They used to treat a nigga like a step child
I felt like that white dude on 8 Mile
If-If you said I could hit I'm footing 8 miles
I'm just keeping it G now I'm pimping throughout 8 towns
Now I know these niggas hate me
Young nigga getting fans like A/C

I'm the bomb you can't disarm me
I need multiple cuts like a swiss army
And I hope that she ain't looking for no prince charming
Charm yo ass in the cab on the next morning
Tell the driver gas pedal, yo Suzy I got cash to blow
Follow the leader, in high school I was an under-achiever
Made haters believers, or beliebers, look at me sir
Went from nobodies to 20k for a feature
Eat your heart out used to take the bart out
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out
When you walk in the building the bitches run out
It should be already platinum before it come out
We should do it major look in the eyes of my haters they say

[Hook]

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook][Hook: Sage the Gemini]

I look at the bigger picture

Yeah, yeah, they be hatin' on a nigga
Yeah, I like that

[Verse 1: Sage the Gemini]

Doing these interviews, saying where my heart is
I'm from Fairfield and niggas still mock me the hardest
Just because I can't help you niggas be artists
And got the nerve to tell me don't forget where I started
I know where I started nigga thats the bottom
Tryna buy equipment where money was the problem
I can outsmart em'
Me and my brother Cadence
Both thirteen tryna clean nigga's places
Just to buy our first microphone at Gordon's
Around this time you niggas
Wouldn't think to record shit
Sage wasn't important, I don't know you niggas
Remember I used to say, "I'ma show you niggas"
MTV, a few songs on the billboards
You niggas still at home hangin' out with your real boys
And I'm the man, you niggas are still boys
And I'm big on niggas ears like keloids

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sage the Gemini]

I got a few wins under a young nigga's belt
I understand you feel like I'm the easiest help
I'm trying to own the whole house listen to me well
Because sometimes your foot in the door just don't help
I can't help you if I'm tryna help myself
Get off my chest I can't invest with no wealth
Like I said, most of yall' wasn't there when I started
Might of made it, but on paper I'm still a new artist
The reason I got a name from when it was dry, or it pouring
I was tryna make beats past four in the mornin'
Not under bitches who be drinking and smokin'
But under the PC, hella' slow when it's loadin'
The message for you niggas, when I'm done and they're homeless
Don't be hatin' when I can't help put you on
Strive for the spot till the struggle is gone
But even then, work harder until the struggle is foreign
Hah

Slow downOkay, so I'm looking at the Rap Song charts for last week, trying to figure out what to review, and I gotta say, I'm kinda happy with the top 5. Holy Grail's not too bad of a song, and it's number one. And the next three slots are taken up by all three of Macklemore's singles, Same Love being number two, which is awesome. Now, what song rounds out the top five of this list? A song called "Gas Pedal", by Sage the Gemini, featuring… IamSu…? So, this guy's on a short list of people who thought it was a good idea to have their rap name be a short sentence. Isn't that right, Souljaboy Tell'em. *shows pic of Souljaboy* Well? Tell em! But for real, who is this Sage the Gemeni and why is his song so high on the charts? Can't be name recognition, because I don't know anyone who's heard of him before. In fact, I haven't even heard this song before, but hey, if it's this high, the guy must have a real explosive single on his hands. Lemme check it out real quick!

*2 minutes later*

Well, that was terrible. Let's make fun of it!

*video intro*

Ever get the feeling rappers are taking themselves way too serious?

*beat starts*

No, yeah, this cheesy, 4 note beat was totally worthy of that ominous intro

H-h-h-holy shit!

I guarantee you nothing in this song warrants that much enthusiasm

Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you tryna make yo ass fall off
Hella thick, I wanna smash them all, now
Speed up, gas pedal
Speed up, gas pedal [5x], now
Speed up, gas pedal [3x]

Remember when I said nothing in this song warrants that much enthusiasm. Yeah, Apparently Sage believes that, too. Really, are we still doing this "drain the energy from your voice in order to sound cool" thing? Because there's a difference between sounding like you're really cool, calm and in charge and sounding like you're... just really bored

I mean, dude, do you even wanna be here right now? Because, I don't need my party songs sounding like a mandatory activity that you're trying to get over with as soon as possible. At least when Tech N9ne puts on his serious voice, he still lets you know that whatever he's doing, he's liken' it

*"bout to Bubble": We're smokin', and drinkin', and humpin', and likin' it"*

With this chorus, I just get this feeling like he's trying to sound all mature and unaffected by the very idea of fun, which sends me the wrong vibe, because the one person I don't want to hang out with at a party is the douche bag who wants to act like he's too good to show an emotion beyond, "Maybe if I act like I don't care about anything, I can trick girls into thinking I'm interesting". He does pick up some energy in the verses, though, but by then, the spiritless tone of the music has already taken precedent

Black money let them hoes say amen
I'm just tryna make it clear boy Ray-Bans

Sunglasses don't improve your eye sight; they actually make things dimmer. I suppose he could be talking about the branch of that company that makes eyeglasses, but that's not usually what people think of when you say Ray-bans. Also, you tried to rhyme "amen" with "Ray-Bans", so, no points for you

I'm a great man

Who are you REALLY trying to convince, Sage the Gemeni? Me, or your Dungeons and Dragons rap name?

I play a hole every night DJ amen

Huh. I figured a golf pun would be in order for that play on words

I'm S-A-G-E who would like to know?

Nobody, in about 3 months

Fee-Fi fo-fum large me in yo throat *laugh*

*Ugh...*

West-side baby do what you do
And you got tail, what that shit do

What's funny is that, the first line here just sounds like a set-up line, you know, like when someone thinks up a cool punchline, but they can't find a clever way to set it up in the lyric before it, so they just insert a throwaway line that rhymes with the funnier following punchline. Except here, it's like he somehow forgot what that punchline was, and just said another filler line in it's place, which is great, because now we have two lines that aren't interesting...

And you mad cause I spoon, but I don't give a fork
Silverware a nigga out if he actin' a poor spork

I would give this line more credit if he didn't rhyme fork with spork, used "poor spork" as a crappy play on words for "poor sport"… and initially tried to justify his wordplay by awkwardly starting it with an out-of-place lyric where he brags about how dudes are mad that he "spoons". I mean, does "spooning" mean something else where this guy's from? Because as far as I can tell, he's bragging about guys being jealous of his cuddling abilities

Also, I gotta ask real quick: does anyone see a problem with the girls in this music video? Namely that they, uh… *shows girls stiff as statues* look, I'm not asking for you to show hardcore twerking or anything, but… for goodness sake's this is a music video for a song ABOUT girls shaking their asses! At least make it LOOK like somebody might want to dance to this! I mean, when you show all these girls in dark lighting, and posing like mannequins, I can't help but feel that it sends an even worse message. Like, these girls aren't allowed to have enough autonomy to at least LOOK as if they're having a good time. They can only be these sexy, expressionless trophies that he has in his collection. Say what you want about music video with girls in bikini's at backyard pools. At least it fits the mood! This, over all, is trying way too hard to be dark. You're a music video and song about girl's butts. Lighten up. No, seriously, I can barely make out what's happening in this video

Well, enough of that. Sage's verse is over, and now it's time for a boy named Su to spit his verse

She a trick for a dolla bill
And her boyfriend a bitch call him Tyler Perry... Eugh

Wow. Even YOU sound disappointed in that line. Like, Eugh… I didn't even try to rhyme that

I'm in the black bat lookin' scary
On my way to the cake no bake-ARY
Oops bakeries

Oh god, I hate when rappers do that: acknowledging that they said a word that ALMOST rhymed with the line before it, but instead of erasing it and starting again, they mispronounce it and then acknowledge their laziness with a cute little "OOPS! I MEANT to say this, tee-hee," and then continue the rhyme from there. I remember Method Man used to do this sometimes

Method Man:
*"Protect Ya Neck", "Sub crazy"*

Oh yeah, and… some other guy did it sometimes, too…

Lil Wayne:
*"You Ain't Got Nothin'" "Barry Bonds" "Run this Town" "Mr. Carter"*

I mean "bakery", never been no fakary
Lead her to the bathroom, she askin' where you takin' me
Uh, tell her slow down baby
I'm too turned up, it's 'bout to go down, baby

Wait, why are you telling HER to slow down, she's the one trying to figure out where YOU'RE going. As well, I love how his response to her question is basically, "Sorry, I'm too turned up, we have to have sex in this disgusting club bathroom. There ain't no other possible option!!!"

When you hit the stage the people do a 180

Are you still talking to that chick? …cause… you've given us no reason to think you're not still talking to that chick. And… it sounds like you're calling her ugly for some reason...

You niggas so fugazi got a white bitch with me call that ho slim shady

….Would… would your first name happen to be Stan? No, for real, what man refers to an attractive woman as a dude in any way, shape or form? And furthermore, why Slim Shady? Are there honestly… NO other famous white celebrities you could think of? Because, I think you're skipping a lot of details that go into people's heads when they hear someone make a comparison between two things. Because when you say that a girl reminds you of Eminem, the first thing I think is, "What, is she some crazy chick who bashes gay people and fantasizes about killing her girlfriend? I mean, really, why him? Just because he's white, and the girl you're talking about is white? Screw it, then, why stop there? Just go all out!

My chick's white, REAL white: Adolf Hitler

Okay, I think we're done here. Overall, I'd give this song a 0 out of 5. To me, it feels like these guys are just a step below being genuinely clever. Like, they flirt with the idea of making puns that work, but there's just a fundamental misunderstanding of how their wordplay is actually effecting the listener that makes their attempts awkward and unintentionally funny as soon as you so much as take a second glance at it. And furthermore, I…

*the video shows the guy getting up, and the girl with the stocking on her face, I look confused*

*He moves her arm*

…What the hell is going on in this video?

*he lifts her face up*

Why is she wearing that thing on her face?… What IS that thing on her face?

*He moves her some more*

Didn't I say something about how it seemed like these girls were nothing more than mannequins to him?… Yeah…

*She's paused, and then starts dancing

Well, I got my wish of wanting to see some dance in this video...

* She then puts her head down again*

The fu… Anyways, I'm the Rap Critic, you don't have to like my opinion, but I missed when rappers didn't hide their sexual objectification behind artistic pretentiousness[Hook]
Real nigga with this shit
Every bitch here wanna suck my dick (hell yeah)
And the niggas wanna fuck my bitch

[Verse 2: Sage]

[Intro]
Oh, it's a cold world
Don't let yourself be corrupted!
Be yourself! Life's second hand smoke!

[Verse 1: Sage The Gemini]
Huh, life's second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal
Far from being a doctor, my opera is singing [?]
Around here it's just me, buddy Ricky and Cameron
Mean when I heard nobody is anything scared them
Eleven, body street call, outside of the stream, though
Where all the niggas sell pounds, next week riding in three lows
Carrying two hundred, not dollars, thousands
No time for restrooms, you're the size of the house is
Bring a pack to big homie, sit down, let's count it
Odd in here, go by something for your housing
No spin it up, live it up, somebody rob you, just give it up
Don't be selfish, appoint your niggas
Find something to split it up!

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
Ain't even got to smoke to get faded
You ain't gotta drink to say you made it
Oh na na, second hand smoke
No I don't want no second hand smoke!
I ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like
My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life
Ain't thinking with the second hand smoke
Ain't no time for the second hand smoke

[Verse 2: Sage The Gemini]
Yeah, yeah, life's a second hand smoke, thoughts of being a criminal
Money needs, I should find a few girls and start pimping them
How should I ask, when I do it they handle it
Never mind, I go to [?] like pimping and pondering, uh!
And I can't do it to [?] it's record deals
I made it here in A team and Mr. Record Still
Follow up, the real hits me bottled up!
Used to snick soda and make dollar cups
And still never got enough, huh!

[Hook: Eric Bellinger] x 2
Ain't even got to smoke to get faded
You ain't gotta drink to say you made it
Oh na na, second hand smoke
No I don't want no second hand smoke!
I ain't worried about you, I'm a do what I like
My niggas keep it real, we ain't living the life
Ain't thinking with the second hand smoke
Ain't no time for the second hand smoke[Hook: Jay Ant & Sage the Gemini]

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Iamsu]
Cause she wanna break it down for the gang
Tell her partners hang with us
Drank with us, smoke with us
Cause we ain't no broke niggas
Getting money like the white kids in Blankcheck
Fuck off some racks, cause we make it back
Some of them try to ball, but they can't ball like this
Everything I spit is Cocem, get an eight ball of this
Rolex all on  wrist, I be shinin'
And it's Heart Break the click and we be grindin'

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
If you bring your girlfriend, then you messed up
She delivery that good dome, she Fedexed up
No handcuffs, step off, who next up
Got your girlfriend in the game with both her legs up
I be in your girl like Mr. Motion
In it, posin', swerving it, ghostin'
She lovin' the money, but do not get the holdin'
I pull it out and let her hold it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Dave Steezy]
I need a girl down with the click
Sippin' hella Jammie, pourin' rounds and we sip
Profound, hella thick, with a grip that will benefit
If you ain't tallking money, you irrelevant
I'm hella been, with the HBK Gang
If you ain't fucking then bitch you can't hang
Three's up high and we banging the same
Ain't nothing changed
But the numbers by the name
I hope we change it for the fame
Tell her bring some weed cause that shit is essential
And if she don't smoke then she don't meet my credentials
I'm just gettin' money, dressed in that ill shit
And I tend to kill shit, school them as a field trip
Coolin' with my niggas and i'm getting high
And you lame niggas barely even gettin' by
And if she wanna be down and live her life
We just tryna get it my nigga
So let get it right

[Hook]

[Interlude][Hook]
I'm sorry for what I did, Please baby come home
And I'm gonna make it up to ya by the end of this song
And I been alone, since you been gone, baby
Just a kiss (3X)
Just a kiss (3X)
All it takes is one, all it takes is one

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Mentally been pushing away
My past got me feeling some way
I've been tryna get better
But I always up or out of the states
Came home calling you babe
Number changed, I'm kinda late
Fears of you with another man
But I hope you're listening I gotta say
Excuse me from my absence
Things bad but I ain't been asking
Been working like a movie
So I hope you ain't been casting
You ain't even sleeping
You call, I'm in a meeting
Can't talk I'm meeting greeting
You don't need this treatment
So

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay
Feel me, when I say this
Your attention, I ain't paid it
All it takes is achings
And I hope it makes the A list
I've been acting all boring
And I ain't worried about scoring
But you do got the million dollar body
Now that is Forbes list
You've been down since day one
You still down when the day's done
Girl you kill it like Jason
Your [?] like [?]
Girl you got your game face on but take that shit off
Hard work dealing with this bullshit
Now it's time for your day off
