[Part I: 0 to 100]

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Part II: The Catch Up]

[Bridge]
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

[Verse 2]
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

[Outro: James Blake] ×9
Could it be the way that I'll catch up[Produced by Key Wane]

[Intro: Aziz Ansari (from the movie "Funny People")]
"I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy"

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got, nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same, J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing, Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit, and my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets, I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales, I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances, then I just got paid like eight advances
God damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental, I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do and still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple, I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything -- everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth
Load the nine, leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit, probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues, I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom and still gotta pull out
But that's just me, and I ain't perfect, I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it, niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (no more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous, clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
‘Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man, now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook]

[Outro: Baka]
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G. Been a East Side ting. Scarborough ting from time, G, been have up di ting dem from time, G. So I don't know what's wrong with these little wasteman out here eh? Y'all need to know yourself."[Produced by Nineteen85, Majid Jordan, and Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Hook]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
It's hard to do these things alone
Just hold on, we're going home

[Verse + Hook]

[Bridge: Majid Jordan]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby

[Hook][Verse 1]
Had hit records on my demo
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental
I own that mu'fucka
Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

[Hook]
What's the move? Can I tell the truth?
If I was doing this for you then I'd have nothing left to prove
Nah, this for me though
I'm just tryna stay alive and take care of my people
And they don't have no award for that
Trophies, trophies
And they don't have no award for that
Shit don't come with trophies, ain't no envelopes to open
I just do it cause I'm 'sposed to, nigga

[Verse 2]
Bitch I go to Dreams with a suitcase
I got my whole country on a new wave
She like "I heard all your niggas stay where you stay"
House so big I haven't seen them boys in two days
Bitch, I use a Walkie-Talkie just to get a beverage
I saw my parents split up right after the wedding
That taught my ass to stay committed, fuck the credit
Bitch check the numbers, I'm the one who really get it
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "doing-me-and-only-God-can-judge" song
"I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-you-thought-it-was" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just because" song
Damn

[Hook][Part 1: Pound Cake, Produced by Boi-1da, Matthew Burnett, and Jordan Evans]

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty. Like back in the old days. You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course, compliments of the company, and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last, all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
After hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents, but thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a carrot cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel

[Part 2: Paris Morton Music 2, Produced by Detail]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, fuck all that "Happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas
When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy and not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought "Fuck it"
It's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came
And got me out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dog
Nothing was the same, dog[Produced by The Fam; co-produced by Boi-1da]

[Hook]
Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later how am I the man still
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Man, you know I had to...

[Verse]
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard boiled
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say "Okay if you say so"
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I can never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so and so, where did they go?
They too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it
I mean for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to...oh wait sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
SZN

[Hook]

[Outro]
That's why I don't read the news, it’s garbage
And the editor that wrote the thing, he's garbage
Got guys on my back about schedulin', saying it's too tough
Well guess what?
It's Division-1 football! It's the SEC!
Heck, you pledged, didn't ya?
Go play intramurals, brother, go play intramurals[Verse 1]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga
That's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Hook]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh, well
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language, now you're talkin' my language
Been ready it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Hook]

[Outro: Birdman]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote nines, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly it's jet time, stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga, stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga, stunt nigga[Produced by Mike Zombie]

[Intro]
Started...
(Zombie on the track)

[Hook]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my momma's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show and we...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here, that's popping off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame, cause we...

[Hook][Produced by DJ Dahi]

[Verse 1]
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see if I'm finished

[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Intro: Woman on phone]
Hello? Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good.. you still working?
Tonight... right now? Did I go out? Yeah, I went out
I went.. I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit.. wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious..

[Verse 1]
Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that I'mma call her anyway and say

[Hook]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

[Bridge]
(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

[Verse 2]
Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that I'mma call you anyway and say

[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, "Well, I'm sorry"

[Bridge]

[Interlude]
You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no one heard that, I hope no one heard that
Cause if they did, we gonna be in some trouble[Produced by Nineteen85 and Sampha]

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Hook]

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'[Produced by THC and DJ Dahi]

[Verse 1: Drake]
You must remember wakin' up in Paris with the blunt
You must remember fuckin' me like anytime you want
What made us wanna act like we were married for two weeks?
Now we back in California, we don't even speak
That's a no no
Everyone said we look good on paper
You deserve that action
Plus you get more paper than I do, that shit attractive
Things that make me miss you, with Jen and Melissa
(Say Hi, M)
Tell the squad I said what up girl
Look at me, look at me, look at I
Ballin' out, swear I use to be shy
Young nigga
Back when I, was tryna' make a, MI
My nigga, when can I
How is this shit goin' how it is
I always seem to kill it and yet everybody lives
I hope that they remember me, for everything I did
It's some views from the 6
Just some views from the 6

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook 2x]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Hook]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Hook x2][Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment
That’s why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
‘Cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’
And this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty
And this ain’t no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
‘Cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Hook][Produced by PARTYNEXTDOOR, co-produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
Why you keep askin' me about (why)?
She's not here right now, she's not here right now
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Hook]
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
You can be the one to take control, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me

[Verse 2]
Why you keep askin' me about (why)?
Couple other things I’d rather do than talk 'bout that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances
He’s not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now
Spendin' all my days on the Eastside, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh
Tryna wake up and have you with me, oh
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
(I threw my hands in the air said show me somethin')
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house, she made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "when that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me, that my nigga till we gon'
Keeps his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' bout "you gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you a little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley 4 door already
Even as a boy I was the boy already
So you know that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I'm matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for 3rd Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time cause I've lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime said you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a xan for the boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, another xan for your boy
You would probably fly out to Japan for the boy
You would probably kill another man for the boy
You would probably...
You would probably lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy
(Fring)[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now that's me
That's me, and the voice in your ear
That's me, can't you see
That I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always getting faded

[Hook]
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Ok, look, I'm honest. Girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says "I know you changed
I never see you cause you're always busy doing things"
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Hook]

[Outro]
May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accepts you..[Produced by Noah "40" Shebib]

[Hook]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse 1]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Hook][Intro]
Gotta do what I gotta do

[Verse 1]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now? Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah, fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic, they say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

[Hook]
